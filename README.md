Dicom Organizer recursively scans a given root folder for DICOM files, extracts relevant metadata, and organizes the files into a structured output folder.# DICOM Organizer

## Description
This Python script recursively scans a given root folder for DICOM files, extracts relevant metadata, and organizes the files into a structured output folder. The folder structure is customizable using placeholders for different DICOM tags. Additionally, a CSV report is generated with details of all processed DICOM series.

## Features
- Recursively scans and organizes DICOM files.
- Supports customizable folder structures.
- Utilizes multi-threading for faster processing.
- Generates a CSV report listing all series metadata.
- Handles missing DICOM tags gracefully.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install pydicom tqdm
```

## Usage
Run the script with the following command-line arguments:

```sh
python dcm2dir.py -i <input_folder> -o <output_folder> [-r <csv_report>] [-f <folder_structure>]
```

### Arguments:
- `-i, --input` (required): Path to the root folder containing DICOM files.
- `-o, --output` (required): Path to the destination folder where organized files will be stored.
- `-r, --report` (optional): Path to save the generated CSV report.
- `-f, --folder-structure` (optional): Custom folder structure using placeholders. See "Folder Structure" section.

### Example Usage:
```sh
python dcm2dir.py -i ./dicoms -o ./organized -r report.csv -f "%i/%x_%t/%s_%d"
```

### Folder Structure:
The folder structure can be customized using placeholders for different DICOM tags. The following placeholders are available:
- `%a`: Antenna (coil) name
- `%b`: Basename
- `%c`: Comments
- `%d`: Description
- `%e`: Echo number
- `%f`: Folder name
- `%g`: Accession number
- `%i`: ID of patient
- `%j`: SeriesInstanceUID
- `%k`: StudyInstanceUID
- `%m`: Manufacturer
- `%n`: Name of patient
- `%o`: MediaObjectInstanceUID
- `%p`: Protocol
- `%r`: Instance number
- `%s`: Series number
- `%t`: Exam date
- `%u`: Acquisition number
- `%v`: Vendor
- `%x`: Study ID
- `%z`: Sequence name

If `-f` is not provided, the default structure is used:
```
"-f %i/%x_%t/%s_%d"
```

## Output
The script organizes DICOM files into the specified output folder following the given structure. A CSV report is saved, containing the following columns:
- SubjectID
- ExamDate
- ExamID
- SeriesID
- SeriesDescription

## Notes
- Non-alphanumeric characters in metadata are replaced with underscores.
- If a DICOM tag is missing, a default placeholder `na` is used.
- The script uses multi-threading for better performance.
